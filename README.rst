[WIP]

struct of a node: attributes and children

docutils.dtd
    define which attributes and children allow to be under a node

nodes abstract class
    so far, it is unused

create a node
    `Node(:node, pairs..., node/string ...)`; `:node` name follow docutils

create a state
    `State(:state)` a singleton; `:state` name has no undercore

generated doctree should be the same as generated by docutils, in addition to "level", "line", "source"

consider `<literal_block xml:space="preserve">` to be `<literal_block>`
or generated by `LiteralBlock` to make it simpler

consider creating node with CapCamel style (align with struct from Julia style guide)
and basic type checking (from DTD)

consider creating system message nodes

perhaps all system message nodes take no arguments and could be constant
